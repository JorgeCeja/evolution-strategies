# evolution-strategies

Distributed Natutal Evolution Strategies build with pytorch and ray. This project was created because there were no simple distributed evolution strategies implementations I could find. The project's goal is to be minimalistic (simple to understand) and modular (easy to implement your own strategy).  

### Built with

- Pytorch
- Numpy
- Ray
- OpenAI Gym
